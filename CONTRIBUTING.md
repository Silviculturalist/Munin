# Contributing to pyforestry

First off, thank you for considering contributing to pyforestry! We welcome contributions from the community. Your help is essential for keeping it great. Please remember to adhere by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This document provides a set of guidelines for contributing to pyforestry.

## Submitting Changes

The best way to contribute is by submitting a pull request. We'll follow this basic process:

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  Make your changes. Add or update tests for your changes.
3.  Ensure your code lints and passes all tests.
4.  Issue a pull request to the `main` branch, describing the changes you've made.

## Coding Style and Conventions

To maintain order and clarity, we adhere to the following conventions.

### Code Style

-   All Python code should follow the **PEP 8** style guide: <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>
-   We use **`black`** for auto-formatting and **`ruff`** for linting to ensure a consistent codebase.

### Function and Variable Naming


### Documentation

-   All functions and classes must include **Google-style docstrings**, which are parsed by Sphinx to generate the online documentation.
-   Docstrings must describe the function's purpose, arguments, return values, and include a source citation and a runnable example.
