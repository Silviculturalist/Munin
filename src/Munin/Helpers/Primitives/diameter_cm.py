"""Module for handling diameter measurements and conversions.

This module provides functions and classes to represent tree
stem diameters in centimeters and to perform unit conversions,
calculations of basal area per tree, and validation of inputs.

Classes:
    Diameter: Represents a diameter measurement in cm with optional unit conversion.

Functions:
    diameter_to_basal_area: Compute basal area (cmÂ²) from diameter.

class Diameter_cm(float):

    A diameter measurement in centimeters, with metadata.

    This class subclasses `float` to store a diameter value (cm) while
    also carrying:

    Attributes:
        over_bark (bool): Whether the diameter is measured over bark.
        measurement_height_m (float): Height at which the diameter was measured (in meters).
