    A spatially explicit single tree: (x, y, [z]) in a coordinate system + attributes.

    Attributes:
    -----------
    position : Position | tuple[float,float] | tuple[float,float,float] | None
        The location of the tree in some coordinate system.
    species : TreeName | str | None
        The species of the tree (or a string name to be parsed).
    age : Age | float | None
        The age of the tree. If an Age enum is used, it wraps the value in AgeMeasurement.
    diameter_cm : Diameter_cm | float | None
        The diameter (cm) if known. If a float is passed, it can be coerced to a Diameter_cm.
    height_m : float | None
        The height (m) of the tree if known.
    weight_n : float
        Number of trees represented by Tree object. Defaults to 1.0.
    uid : int | None
        A unique identifier for the Tree object.
